It is a revised version of a preliminary work for my MSc studies, evaluating the evidence of the effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on biological stress markers. 



An extensive, consistent amount of research suggested the link between stress psychobiological processes and negative health outcomes (O’Connor, 2020). 

Yet, stress is an essential component of our performance and survival. Acute stress allows us to respond to threat exposure by preparing our body to act. Moreover, a medium level of stress has been associated with increased memory task performance (Sandi, 2013). Only excessive and long-term stress is detrimental to our physical and mental health.    



### The biological model of stress

In its simplest form, stress initiates the need for the body to maintain homeostasis, whereby it can regulate itself through activation of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and the release of hormones.

Two systems are involved, the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary (SAM) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. When a threatening stimulus occurs, the amygdala is activated and sends a signal to the hypothalamus, which in turn, activates the SAM and triggers the release of noradrenaline. The adrenal medulla will also release adrenaline leading to an increased heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory frequency. This rapid response has been called the “fight-or-flight" response (Selye, 1951).   

The other system involved the activation of the HPA axis and the release of corticotrophin release factor by the hypothalamus, which stimulates the production of glucocorticoid cortisol.   

Based on these biological mechanisms for coping with stress, McEwen used the concepts of *allostasis* and *allostatic overload* to explain when the stress response is overused and lead to pathology (McEwen, 1998).    



### Stress and mindfulness-based stress reduction 

It has been suggested that by regulating the body's response to stress, the Buddhist-rooted practice of mindfulness plays a role in stress reduction.    

As mindfulness refers to a wide range of practices, its definition remains discussed, but it usually refers to two components, self-regulation of attention to the internal and external experiences maintained in the present moment and an attitude including non-judgment, curiosity, openness, and acceptance (Kabat-Zinn, 1995; Bishop, 2004).    

Initially developed for chronic-pain management (Kabat-Zinn, 1982), mindfulness-based stress reduction program (MBSR) is a secular and standardised 8-weeks program consisting of weekly group meetings of around 2.5 hours, with a silent retreat day between week 6 and 7 of the course. The program is composed of theoretical material, experiential learning as well as home practices. The practices taught are guided meditations (body sensations, breath, open-awareness...) as well as mindful movements and mindful eating.   

MBSR has been suggested to be effective with stress, depression, anxiety, and improving the quality of life (Khoury, 2010; Creswell, 2017). However, these studies rely on self-reports and self-rating questionnaires, which in addition to difficulties of assessing mindfulness and the scales themselves (Bergomi, 2013), face some challenges due to their subjectivity and bias (Van Dam, 2018). Therefore, more objective measures like biological markers must be considered.  Ultimately, neuroscience studies include these latter to evaluate the stress response as well as self-report measures. 

Which biological markers to consider? What are the current evidence of the effects of MBSR on biological mechanisms though which stress impacts health? 

The overview will be divided into parts, each of them addressing a different category of markers: 

\- Part 1 will be focusing on cortisol, the so-called "stress hormone".

\- Part 2 will look at cardiovascular responses. 

\- Part 3 will explore the cellular markers for immune functions as well as the exciting advancement of research on aging.

\- Last but not least, as stress involves the nervous system, part 4 will discuss neuroimaging studies investigating the neurological effects of MBSR.
