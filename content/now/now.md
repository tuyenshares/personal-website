Its purpose is to reply to this familiar question: What are you doing now? ðŸ™‚

_Last updated on February 2021, in rainy Singapore_


So, NOW, 

**I am interested in...**

- Reading more about organisation behaviours (Any recommendation...?)

**I am learning...**

- A new module for my Masters in applied neuroscience
- Python
- [Maths for machine learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning)

**I am building...**

- This [little piece of digital garden](/explore) seeds by seeds
- Some [dashboards](https://tuyenshares.github.io/) for my training on data analysis

**I am reading...** 

- Fiction: A Balzac (to give him another chance...)
- Non-Fiction: [Science fictions](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52199285-science-fictions) from Stuart Ritchie


**Also, I am trying...**

- To rebuild a momemtum for [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/tuyenmoves)
