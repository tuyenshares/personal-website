So, NOW, 

_Updated on January 2021_

**I am interested**

- in reading more about behavioural economics (Any recommendation...?)

**I am learning**

- A new module for my Masters in applied neuroscience
- Python
- [Maths for machine learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning)

**I am building**

- This [little piece of digital garden](/explore) seeds by seeds
- Some [dashboards](https://tuyenshares.github.io/) for my training on data analysis

**I am reading**

- Rereading Man's searching for meaning 
- [The righteous mind](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11324722-the-righteous-mind) from Jonathan Haidt

Next would probably be : 

- Fiction: A Balzac (to give him another chance...)
- Non-Fiction: [Science fictions](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52199285-science-fictions) from Stuart Ritchie


**Also, I am trying...**

- To rebuild a momemtum for running
- To meditate more than 45 minutes per day
