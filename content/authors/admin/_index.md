A corporate lawyer turned data explorer and MSc student in applied neuroscience, I am passionate about research on behavioral science and ethics in artificial intelligence.

Currently involved in a full-time programme learning data analytics, I am teaching myself Python, R and machine learning. You can find the repository of my projects [here](https://tuyenshares.github.io/) and some learning reflections about them [here](https://tuyenshares.com/tag/data/). 

In my spare time, I enjoy being in nature, walking and running, as well as in museums and galleries where I get inspired. A MBSR trained teacher, I also sometimes conduct mindfulness workshops.
