A corporate lawyer turned data explorer and MSc student in applied neuroscience, I am passionate about looking at why we do things we do and how we can ethically leverage data to contribute to our wellbeing as a person and as a society.

I am currently teaching myself data analytics with Python and R as well as machine learning. You can find the repository of my data projects [here](https://tuyenshares.github.io/) and some learning reflections and miscellaneous thoughts [here](https://tuyenshares.com/tag/data/). 

A MBSR trained teacher, I care a lot about mental health in organisations and like to dedicate some time to facilitate mindfulness workshops and study the relationship between mindfulness and our brain and behaviours. 

In my spare time, I enjoy being in nature, walking and running, as well as in museums and galleries where I get inspired.
