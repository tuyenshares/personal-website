A corporate lawyer turned data explorer and MSc student in applied neuroscience, I am passionate about looking at why we do things we do and advocating for ethics in data.

I am currently teaching myself data analytics with Python and R as well as machine learning. You can find the repository of my data projects [here](https://tuyenshares.github.io/) and some learning reflections and miscellaneous thoughts [here](https://tuyenshares.com/tag/data/). 

In my spare time, I enjoy being in nature, walking and running, as well as in museums and galleries where I get inspired. A MBSR trained teacher, I also sometimes conduct mindfulness workshops.
