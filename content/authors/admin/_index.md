A former corporate lawyer turned student of applied neuroscience, I am passionate about research on cognitive science and behavioural economics. My field of interest includes particularly studies about the relationships between these topics and mindfulness practices.  

I am also curious about data analytics and data science and is currently self-teaching Python and R. 

In my spare time, I enjoy being in nature, walking and running and be inspired by art in museums and galleries. I am also conducting mindfulness workshops [here](https://prosoke.com/).
