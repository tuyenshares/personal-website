This is not really a blog, this is an ongoing process of writing and sharing about what I care. This is a [digital garden](#).

It is at the same time:
- a journal for my thoughts,
- a portfolio for my projects, 
- a notebook for my reading notes, 
- a collection of advices and wisdom I want to keep about living consciously, 
- a repository for paper reviews and independent research. 

You may encounter some articles that are not fully finished yet or haven't even been started to be written but are under bullet-point format. They are seeds that I am planting with the hope they will bloom. Also, every article can be revised and updated at any time. 

Digital gardens invite for a more creative, contemplative and quiet way of sharing on the Internet. It is a recognition of the power of process, patience and timely growth. It is what makes the beauty of it. 

I'm very excited and I hope you will enjoy the journey with me. I've started to plant some seeds [here](/explore).

Also, I see this garden as a community garden where people is welcome to come, so please feel free to [contact me](#contact) for any feedback so that we can cultivate our gardens together.
