I recently came across this concept of [digital garden](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/) that has been [burgeoning for quite a long time](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) and [growing on the web since 2020](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners). Rethinking the traditional way of blogging, digital gardens seems to invite for a more creative, contemplative and quiet way of sharing on the Internet. It was instantly appealing to me.

2020 - this year where a lot have been questioned and disrupted - has forced the majority of us to reshape our life...  I feel that this trend of digital garden follows the same movement towards slowing down and reframing our priorities. This is in direct contrast with the current use of a vast part of blogs on the web, focusing solely on the audience. By essence, digital gardens are more inward-oriented and are a call for more [vulnerability](#) when sharing publicly. 

It is all about the process, patience and timely growth. 

That reminds me the start of blogging when it was more about sharing personal thoughts than the end of result for professional content marketing. 

Digital gardens are basically a collection of notes that can be published at various stages. They are not definitive and can be updated at any time. 

Gardens imply some dirt and mess - except the "jardins Ã  la franÃ§aise" but they are exceptions. Digital gardens are not neat blogs where everything is ordered but a more open way of thinking and sharing our interests that are growing and blooming with time.

The question of imperfection is an everyday challenge and personally, this a good way to force me to practice letting go and publish my thoughts even though there are not completely fully formed. 

Technically, digital gardens often involve non-linear web design and bi-directional links that connect the articles between them, creating an interrelated network of notes, conducting one idea to another, allowing connections, comparisons and contradiction. 
This is often mentioned  along with an other system that I've also recently experimented for organising my research projects, [the Zettelkasten method](#). 

But as this article mentioned, even though there are some technical guidelines, digital gardens don't really follow rules  and I think this is the beauty of it. I believe there is still space for some creativity in the form they can take. 
_(By the way, I still want to improve these bi-directional links on this website. So if you have a good guide for me to experiment some new designs, please let me know, I would be glad to check it out. In the meantime, I built this space where updates can be seen on the top of the article, backlinks at the end of the page and alerts have been set up wherever work is still in progress and.)_

Whereas the Zettlekasten method is private and for some, a "second brain", the digital garden is a public repository of notes that aimed to be shared. 

I've come to the idea of public learning quite recently. After pushing myself forward and going against my fear of being judged, I decided to give it a try. Learning in public has been said to be a way for better learning by seeking feedbacks. It is also a way to measure how far we are in the process of expertise of a subject. 


The way I see it, this space is a blog but with more freedom where I share my thoughts across diverse fields that caught my interest. It is also, without being exhaustive, a portfolio for my projects, especially in data analytics, a digital notebook for my reading notes, a collection of advices and wisdom I want to keep about living consciously, a repository for academic papers reviews and independent research writings. 

I am not sure I have fully understood the whole concept but I like this idea of planting seeds of ideas, sharing what we are trying to nurture and attend to them publicly with the hope they can grow and blossom. 

I'm very excited and I hope you will enjoy the journey with me. You can [start exploring here](https://tuyenshares.netlify.app/explore/).

Also, I see this garden as a community garden where people is welcome to come, so please feel free to [contact me](https://tuyenshares.netlify.app/about/#contactme) for any feedback so that we can cultivate our gardens together.
