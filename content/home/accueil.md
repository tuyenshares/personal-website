This is not really a blog, this is an ongoing process of writing and sharing about what I care. This is a [digital garden](/what-are-digital-gardens).

It is, at the same time,
- a journal for my thoughts,
- a portfolio for my projects, 
- a notebook for my reading notes, 
- a repository for paper reviews and independent research, 
- a learning log for my reflections on my lifelong learning journey,
- a collection of advices and wisdom I want to keep about living consciously, 


Articles will be at various stages of development: you may encounter some notes that are not fully finished yet or haven't even been started to be written in any other form than bullet points. They are seeds that I'm planting with the hope they will bloom one day. Or they might just not grow, and it is ok. 

(Digital) gardens celebrate the power of work, process, patience and timely growth. They are invites for a more creative, contemplative and quiet way of sharing on the Internet. It is what makes their beauty to me. 

So thank you for passing by, I'm very excited to share this garden with you :) [Here are some seeds I've started to plant](/explore). I hope you will enjoy the journey with me.

Also, I see this garden as a part of a bigger community garden where people is welcome to come, so please feel free to [contact me](#contact) if you have any feedback, question, suggestion... so that we can tend to our gardens together.
