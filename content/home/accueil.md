This place is aimed to be an open knowledge platform where I share with you all the insights I learned from my current studies in applied neuroscience and also from independent research based on my diverse personal interests. 

I believe that knowledge is not a static but dynamic and changes when shared and discussed. 

I hope that [sharing publicy what I learned](#) will not only improve my learning process but also help you in any ways and contribute to the conversation.
